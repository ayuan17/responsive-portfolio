            <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Alex and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I am currently participating in a coding bootcamp hosted by Georgia Tech. It's a fast paced course where you will learn all of the tools necessary to become a developer in 24 weeks. During this time, I plan to hone my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript and many other languages.</p>


            <p>My name is Alex Yuan and I am 26 years old. I am currently attending a coding bootcamp at Georgia Tech University. It's been pretty fast paced but I expect to learn a lot from this course. I hope to start my career as a developer within the next year or so. I have so much to learn but I am also willing to put in the work. This has been an exciting journey so far and I can't wait to increase my knowledge of developing. It feels really good to figure something out and watch the result display itself before you. It's awesome!</p>
